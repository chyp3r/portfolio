                  <p>The main aim of the course is to provide students with design-oriented creative thinking skills. Students have the opportunity to experience the empathy, definition, idea generation, prototyping and testing steps of design-oriented thinking throughout the entire education process.</p>
                  <p>The training duration is 12 weeks. Students work with two-dimensional drawing programs, three-dimensional modeling programs, 3D Printers, Laser Cutting Machines, CNC Machines, and Wood Forming Machines and present their own unique designs and products. Students exhibit the projects they prepared within the scope of the Design and Production Course at the "Project Festival".</p>
                  <p>As a graduation project, we were expected to design a new product that could improve bus travel.</p>
